Advanced methods to work with active records

Now y'all know the basic format of Active Records Relation, lets get actual usable content from it

the methods we can use with the Relations object

The more advanced active records methods

//will be using "Table" as an sample table in postgresql

in addition to pulling usable data from your database, you can:

  check for existence -->> Table.exists? -->> will return true or false
  check if any records match a criteria -->> Table.any? -->> will return true or false
  check if multiple records match criteria -->> Table.many? -->> true or false

you can use these on the model itself (as shown above) or with a relation or association

relation:
Table.where(:column => true).any?
